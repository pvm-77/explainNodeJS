# Introduction to Nodejs
## what is nodejs
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.


A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.

When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.

This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.

Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

## history and evolution of nodejs
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side to build scalable, high-performance applications. Here's a step-by-step overview of the history and evolution of Node.js:

In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js as a side project while working for Joyent, a cloud computing company. The initial goal was to create a web server that could handle a large number of concurrent connections.

In May 2009, Dahl released the first version of Node.js to the public, version 0.1.0. It was based on Google's V8 JavaScript engine and included a basic HTTP server.

Over the next year, Node.js gained popularity in the developer community and began to attract contributors. By 2010, the project had over 100 contributors and was being used by several high-profile companies.

In 2011, Node.js version 0.4.0 was released, which included support for Windows operating systems, as well as many other improvements and bug fixes.

In 2012, Node.js version 0.8.0 was released, which included significant performance improvements and new features, such as the built-in cluster module for scaling applications across multiple CPU cores.

In 2014, the Node.js project was forked by a group of developers who were unhappy with the direction of the project and created a new project called io.js. The io.js project quickly gained support and began to release new versions of the runtime.

In 2015, the Node.js and io.js projects announced that they would be merging back together, with the io.js project codebase becoming the basis for future versions of Node.js. This merger resulted in the formation of the Node.js Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development and promotion of Node.js.

Since the merger, Node.js has continued to evolve and improve, with several major releases that have introduced new features and improvements, including version 6 in 2016, version 8 in 2017, version 10 in 2018, and version 12 in 2019.

In addition to being used for building web servers, Node.js has also become popular for building other types of applications, such as command-line tools, desktop applications, and even mobile applications using frameworks like React Native.

Overall, the history and evolution of Node.js have been characterized by a strong community of developers and a focus on performance and scalability. With its continued development and adoption, Node.js is likely to remain a popular choice for server-side JavaScript development for years to come.

Overall, Node.js provides a powerful and flexible platform for building a wide range of applications, with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and developer productivity.


## how nodejs works?
Node.js is based on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This means that Node.js is capable of handling multiple requests at the same time, without blocking the execution of other requests. When a request comes in, Node.js handles it by creating an event and adding it to a queue. The event loop then processes these events and executes the corresponding event handlers.

Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests, but it does so in a non-blocking way. This allows Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections without using a lot of resources. Node.js also provides a rich set of built-in modules and packages that can be used to build server-side applications.

```js
// create server 
const http=require('http')
const app=http.createServer((request,response)=>{
    response.writeHead(200,{'Content-Type':'text/plain'})
    response.end('hello world')
})
const PORT=3001;
app.listen(PORT)

console.log(`server is running on PORT ${PORT}`);
```





```

According to the ECMAScript standard, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is intended to be called by that function at a later time. The callback function can be used to provide a way for the calling function to notify the caller when some asynchronous operation has completed or when some other event has occurred.

The ECMAScript specification defines a callback function as follows:

"A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is expected to be called by that function at some point in the future. The primary purpose of using a callback function is to allow the caller to specify behavior that will be executed later, when some event or condition has occurred."

Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous programming, where they allow for non-blocking execution of code. By providing a callback function, the calling function can continue to execute while the asynchronous operation is being performed, and then call the callback function when the operation is complete. This can help to improve the performance and responsiveness of applications that rely on asynchronous operations.

##  Modules and packages

###  `Module`

- A module is just a file `one script is one module`.
- A module in Node.js is a single file or a group of related files that export a set of functions or variables for use in other parts of an application.
- Modules are typically small, focused units of code that serve a specific purpose.
- Module can be used to encapsulate and reuse functionality, improving code organization and maintainability.

**definition2**
a module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates a set of related functions, classes, and variables. Modules help you organize your code into reusable units, making it easier to maintain and scale your applications.

**example**
```js
//📁 utils.js
function info(params){
    console.log(params);
}
function error(params){
    console.error(params);
}
```
```js
export default {info,error}
//📁 app.js
import logger from '.utils.js'
logger.info('i am custom logger');
```
>in this example `utils.js` is a `module` that exports two functions `info` and `error`.These functions can be used in other parts of the application by importing the `module utils.js`.


#### types of modules
1. `built-in modules`
2. `external modules`
3. `user defined modules`

#### How  to  create module?

in javascript the `import` and `export` statements are used to facilitate module management and code reuse.

ways to use `export` and `import` in nodejs 

#### EXPORT
the export statement is use to export function ,object or variable from a module so that it can be used in other modules.There are two types of export in javascript(here nodejs) `named export ` and  `default export`  

#### Default export

- default export allow only one value per module this value can be function ,object or variable/primitive value.
- to create a default export we can use `export default` statement followed by the value we want to export

```js
// utils.js
const info=(params)=>{
    console.log(params);
}
export default info

```
```js
// app.js
import info from './utils.js'
info('hi all')

```
####  Named export 

named export allow us to export multiple values from a module. we can export functions,object or variables by using the `export` statement followed by the name of the value we want to export 
```js
// utils.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

// app.js
import { add, subtract } from './utils.js';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(subtract(3, 2)); // Output: 1
```

####  import 
The import statement is used to import a function, object, or variable from another module. We can use the import statement followed by the name of the module we want to import from and the name of the value we want to import.
```js

// utils.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;

// app.js
import { add } from './utils.js';
console.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```
We can also use the import * as statement to import all the exports of a module into a namespace.
```js
// utils.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

// app.js
import * as utils from './utils.js';
console.log(utils.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
console.log(utils.subtract(3, 2)); // Output: 1
```     

**NOTE**: However, there are certain types of functionality that we cannot import from other files/modules directly, such as:

Variables: We cannot import a variable directly from another module, as variables are not exported by default. Instead, we can export them as named exports or use a function to retrieve them.
```js
// module.js
const myVariable = 'Hello, world!';
export { myVariable };

// main.js
import { myVariable } from './module.js';
console.log(myVariable); // "Hello, world!"

```
Private members: We cannot import private members of a module, as they are not exposed for use outside of the module. Private members are usually denoted with a leading underscore (_) to indicate that they are intended for internal use only.
```js
// module.js
const _myPrivateVariable = 'This is private!';
export function myFunction() {
  console.log(_myPrivateVariable);
}

// main.js
import { myFunction } from './module.js';
myFunction(); // "This is private!"
```
Circular dependencies: We should be careful when importing modules that have circular dependencies (i.e., when two or more modules depend on each other). This can lead to infinite loops and cause errors in our code. To avoid this, we can refactor our code to remove the circular dependency or use a workaround such as lazy loading or dependency injection.
```js
// moduleA.js
import { myFunctionB } from './moduleB.js';
export function myFunctionA() {
  console.log('This is function A!');
  myFunctionB();
}

// moduleB.js
import { myFunctionA } from './moduleA.js';
export function myFunctionB() {
  console.log('This is function B!');
  myFunctionA();
}

// main.js
import { myFunctionA } from './moduleA.js';
myFunctionA(); // This will cause an error due to circular dependencies.

```
### some rules for export and import 
Exporting variables or members that are not defined in the current module scope: When we try to export a variable or member that is not defined in the current module scope, we will get a ReferenceError at runtime.

Importing variables or members that are not exported by the target module: When we try to import a variable or member that is not exported by the target module, we will get a TypeError at runtime.

Importing or exporting circular dependencies: When two or more modules have circular dependencies, it can lead to issues with importing and exporting, as shown in the example above.

Exporting or importing certain built-in JavaScript objects: Some built-in objects in JavaScript cannot be exported or imported, such as Math, JSON, and Date.

Exporting or importing from certain non-JavaScript file types: While JavaScript supports importing and exporting from a wide range of file types, such as .js, .json, and .mjs, some file types, such as .txt or .html, cannot be imported or exported.

Importing or exporting from modules that are not properly configured: In some cases, importing or exporting may not work due to issues with module configuration or other external factors.



#### benfit of modules
the benefits of using modules in javascript are
1. `CODE ORGANIZATION`:modules allow you to break your code into smaller,more manageable pieces,which can be easier to read,test and maintain.
2. `REUSABILITY`:Modules can be reused across multiple parts of your application or in multiple applicatios,making it easier to share code and reduce duplication.
3. `ENCAPSULATION`:module provide a way to encapsulate the implementation details of your code,hiding them from other parts of your application and preventing unintended side effects.
4. `DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT`:modules can specify their dependencies on other modules,making it easiser to manage the dependencies between diffrent parts of your application.
5. `Modularity`: modules allows us to split our code into separate modules, each with its own set of responsibilities. This makes our code easier to maintain, test, and reuse.
```js
// 📁 util.js
export const info=(...params)=>{
    console.log(...params);
}

export const error=(...params)=>{
    console.log(...params);
}
const warn=(...params)=>{
    console.warn(params);
}

```
```js
// 📁 app.js
import { info } from './utils/logger.js';
info('print hello');
```
>In this example, we have two separate modules - `utils.js` and `app.js`. `utils.js` exports a single function `info`, which takes single parameter and print it. `app.js` imports the `info` function from `utils.js` and uses it to print passed parameter. This is an example of how module can be used to create modular, reusable code.


6. `Static analysis`: modules allows for static analysis of the code, which can help to catch errors early in the development process and improve code quality.


### packages

- A package in nodejs is a collection of modules,along with other resources such as configuration files,documentation, and dependencies.
- Packages can be installed and managed using Node Package Manager(npm).
- Packages are typically larger units of code that provide more complex functionality than individual modules.

## Built-in module and External modules

nodejs has a rich built-in modules that provide a wide range of functionality for developing applications.

some  most common built-in modules in nodejs

1. `fs`:: A module for interacting with the file system, including reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, and more.
2. `http`:A module for building HTTP servers and clients.
3. `https`:A module for building HTTPS servers and clients.
4. `path`:a module working with file paths and directory paths
5. `crypto`:a module for cryptographic functions such as hashing and encryption
6. `os`:a module for working with operating system,including getting info about cpu ,memory,and network interfaces
7. `util`:a module that provides various utility functions,such as formatting strings,debugging,and timing functions
8. `events`:a module for building and handling events
9. `stream`:a  module for working with stream of data,such as reading and writing large files or working with network sockets
10. `process`:a module for working with the current Nodejs process, including getting and setting environment variables ,accessing command line arguments and more.


some most common external modules

1. `request`: A library for making HTTP requests from Node.js applications.

2. `chalk`: A library for styling console output with colors and styles.

3. `debug`: A utility library for debugging Node.js applications, providing a simple API for logging and debugging.

4. `winston`: A logging library for Node.js, providing support for multiple transports and log levels.

5. `jsonwebtoken`: A library for working with JSON Web Tokens, providing functions for signing and verifying tokens.

6. `joi`: A library for validating and sanitizing data in Node.js applications, providing a simple and powerful API for defining schemas and validating data.

7. `nodemon`: A utility library that monitors changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server.

8. `uuid`: A library for generating unique identifiers in Node.js applications.

9. `moment-timezone`: A library for working with dates and times in different time zones, extending the moment library.

10. `aws-sdk`: A library for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs from Node.js applications.

### external modules

- in nodejs an external module refers to a Javascript module that is not built into the nodejs runtime environment but instead provided by a separate third party package or library.
- externla modules can be install using npm or ther package manager and can be used to extend the functionality of a nodejs application beyond what is provided by the built in nodejs modules.
- external modules can be used to perform a wide range of tasks such as making http requests interacting with databases handling user authentication and more example-axios,expressand Sequelize
- external modules are typically distributed as packages,which contain the module code as well as necessary dependencies and configuration information.when an external module is installed using npm ,the package and its dependencies are downloaded and stored int `node_modules` directory of the project/application

**NOTE**
in nodejs an external module can be provides in diffrent forms but in practice most external modules are packaged and distributed as npm packages.however,its important to note that not all external modules are necessarily packages and there are some exceptions.

for example an external module can be provided as a single javascript file that is downloaded and included in your nodejs application using a script tag or it can be provided as a collection of js files that you manually include in your application


However, in practice, most external modules are distributed as packages because they often have dependencies and require complex installation procedures that are difficult to manage manually. By packaging modules as npm packages, developers can easily manage and install dependencies, and the packages can be versioned and updated as needed. Additionally, packaging modules as npm packages allows them to be shared and reused across multiple projects.


One example of an external module that is not necessarily a package is the dotenv module. This module allows you to load environment variables from a file into your Node.js application, making it easy to manage configuration settings. The dotenv module is typically installed as a package using npm, but it can also be provided as a standalone JavaScript file that you manually include in your application.

To use the dotenv module as a standalone JavaScript file, you would simply download the file from the official repository and include it in your application using a script tag. This approach is less common than using the dotenv package, but it can be useful in situations where you cannot or do not want to use npm to install packages.

Another example of an external module that is not necessarily a package is the ws module, which is used for WebSocket communication in Node.js. The ws module is typically installed as a package using npm, but it can also be provided as a standalone JavaScript file that you manually include in your application.

Again, while these examples are not typical, they illustrate that external modules can take different forms and do not necessarily need to be provided as packages.

 Note that when using the dotenv module as a standalone file, you will not be able to take advantage of the full range of features provided by the npm package, such as automatic loading of environment variables or support for different file formats.

















we can use module using  directive `import` and `export` 
Export and import directives have several syntax variants.

1. `export` before declarations
2. `export` apart from declarations
   
3. `import as` and `export as`
we can use import/export as under different name 

```js
// 📁 index.js
import {printInfo as info,printError as error} from './utils.js';
info('hi your information has been recieve');
error('hi your error has been detected');

```

```js
// 📁 utils.js
const info=(param)=>{
    console.log(param);
}
const error=(param)=>{
    console.error(param);
}
export {info as printInfo,error as printError}

```
>in `utils.js`, there are two functions `info` and `error` that log messages to the console. The `export` statement at the bottom of the file exports these functions as `printInfo` and `printError`, respectively, using the as keyword to rename the functions during the export.

In `index.js`, the `import` statement is used to import the `printInfo` and `printError` functions from `utils.js`. The `as` keyword is used again to rename the functions during the import, so that they can be accessed using the `info` and `error` identifiers in `index.js`.

Then, the `info` and `error` functions are called with some messages to log to the console. These messages are passed as arguments to the functions and are printed to the console using the `console.log` and `console.error` functions.

4. `export default`

```js
// 📁 index.js
import logger from './utils.js';
logger.info('hi your information has been recieve');
loggererror('hi your error has been detected');

```

```js
// 📁 utils.js
const info=(param)=>{
    console.log(param);
}
const error=(param)=>{
    console.error(param);
}
export default {info ,error }

```

>The export default statement is used to export a single object, function or primitive as the default export of the module. The default export can be imported using any name in the importing module, and the default keyword is used to access the exported value.

In utils.js, the export default statement exports an object containing two functions, info and error. This means that when this module is imported in another module, the default export will be an object containing these two functions.

In index.js, the import statement is used to import the default export from utils.js as an object called logger. This object contains the info and error functions, which can be accessed using dot notation (logger.info and logger.error).

Overall, the use of export default allows us to export a single value as the default export of a module. This can be useful when we want to export a single object or function as the primary export of a module.
<!-- report to done  -->
**NOTE** there can be only 1 export default per file


## differen types of module system 

There are several module systems in JavaScript, each with its own syntax and usage. Here are some of the most popular module systems:

1. CommonJS: CommonJS is a module system used primarily in Node.js. It uses the `require()` function to import modules and the `module.exports` object to export modules.
2. AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition): AMD is a module system designed for use in the browser. It uses the `define()` function to define modules and the `require()` function to import modules.
3. ES6 modules: ES6 modules are the standard module system in modern JavaScript. They use the `import` keyword to import modules and the `export` keyword to export modules.

4. UMD (Universal Module Definition): UMD is a module system that works in both the browser and Node.js. It uses a combination of CommonJS and AMD syntax to define and import modules.

5. SystemJS: SystemJS is a module system that supports multiple module formats, including AMD, CommonJS, and ES6 modules. It allows developers to write code in any module format and then load and use the modules in any environment.

6. Rollup: Rollup is a module bundler that takes ES6 modules as input and generates a single bundle that can be used in the browser. It can also generate CommonJS, AMD, and UMD modules.

The ES6 module system, which uses the import and export keywords, is the most widely used module system in modern JavaScript development. This is because it is the standard module system defined in the ECMAScript specification, and is supported by all modern browsers and Node.js versions.

Some of the benefits of using ES6 modules include:

Declarative syntax: ES6 modules provide a simple and declarative syntax for defining and exporting modules, which makes it easy to understand and use.

Tree-shaking: ES6 modules support tree-shaking, which is a technique used to eliminate unused code from the final bundle. This can significantly reduce the bundle size and improve performance.

Static analysis: ES6 modules are statically analyzable, which means that the module dependencies can be determined at compile-time. This can improve performance and reduce runtime errors.

Encapsulation: ES6 modules provide encapsulation by default, which means that the module scope is isolated from the global scope. This can help prevent naming collisions and improve code maintainability.

Because of these benefits, ES6 modules are widely adopted by modern JavaScript developers and are often the preferred module system for new projects. However, it is important to note that some legacy code and environments may still rely on other module systems, such as CommonJS or AMD.


##  Built-in modules and external modules

## Package Manager for Nodejs

In Node.js, a package manager is a tool that helps developers to manage dependencies and packages in their Node.js projects. It allows developers to easily install, update, and remove packages and their dependencies, ensuring that their projects have all the necessary dependencies to run smoothly.

There are two main package managers in Node.js: npm and Yarn.

1. `npm (Node Package Manager)` 
npm is the default package manager that comes bundled with Node.js. It allows developers to install, manage, and share packages from the npm registry, which is a centralized repository of Node.js packages. Developers can use npm to install packages locally or globally, update packages, and uninstall packages.

2. `Yarn`
Yarn is an alternative package manager that was developed by Facebook. It was designed to address some of the limitations of npm, such as slow install times and inconsistent dependency resolutions. Yarn uses a lockfile to ensure that packages are installed consistently across different environments, and it has a caching mechanism that speeds up the installation process.

Both npm and Yarn use a package.json file to manage dependencies and metadata for Node.js projects. This file contains information about the project, such as the project name, version, and dependencies. Developers can use this file to specify the dependencies and their versions, and the package manager will ensure that all dependencies are installed and up to date.


### Strengths of npm:

1. `Bundled with Node.js`: npm is the default package manager that comes bundled with Node.js, which means that developers don't need to install any additional software to use it.

2. `Large package repository`: npm has a huge repository of packages, with over 1.5 million packages available for developers to use.

3. `Familiarity`: npm has been around for a long time and is widely used, which means that many developers are already familiar with it.


### Strengths of Yarn:

1. `Faster install times`: Yarn uses a caching mechanism that makes installation faster than npm, especially for large projects.

2. `Consistent installations`: Yarn uses a lockfile to ensure that all dependencies are installed consistently across different environments, which can prevent issues that sometimes occur with npm.

3. `Improved security`: Yarn has a built-in mechanism for verifying package integrity, which can help prevent security vulnerabilities.



CommonJS and ES Modules (ESM) are two different systems used for organizing and sharing code in JavaScript.

CommonJS is a module system used in Node.js, designed to work with synchronous code. In CommonJS, modules are loaded synchronously, which means that the code waits for each module to load before moving on to the next one. CommonJS uses the require() function to load modules, and the module.exports object to export them.

ES Modules (ESM) are a module system introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), designed to work with both synchronous and asynchronous code. In ESM, modules are loaded asynchronously, which means that the code doesn't wait for each module to load before moving on to the next one. ESM uses the import and export keywords to load and export modules.

Some key differences between CommonJS and ES Modules include:
Syntax: CommonJS uses require() and module.exports, while ES Modules use import and export.

Asynchronous loading: ES Modules support asynchronous loading of modules, whereas CommonJS only supports synchronous loading.

Static analysis: ES Modules allow for static analysis of the module graph, which can help with tree shaking (removing unused code) and other optimizations. CommonJS does not support static analysis.

Browser support: ES Modules are supported in modern web browsers, while CommonJS is primarily used in Node.js.

Overall, ES Modules offer a more modern, flexible, and powerful way of working with modules in JavaScript, especially for large-scale projects. However, CommonJS is still widely used, particularly in Node.js environments.
